# Class Activity 1

For the first activity we will explore names used to describe various security areas. You are invited to research the definitions of these areas and compare and contrast their purpose.

## Assignment

In the `activity1.md` file, you will find a list of titles/names. For each one, please add one to three sentence description. Then, provide a paragraph explaining how the names to describe these areas of security relate to or different from each other. This list is not comprehensive and you should add more phrases you have come across to describe an area of security.

## Submission

You are welcome to work on this activity together with other individuals in class. However, please make sure you submit individual answers.
